    "question" : "What’s the difference between Available Balance and Full Balance?",
    "answer" : "After you make a transaction or receive some Oxen, the transaction still needs to be confirmed. In about 20 minutes your available balance should update!\nSometimes, when you send Oxen, your available balance will decrease by more than the amount you’ve sent. This is normal, and it’s necessary in order to protect your privacy. Your full balance should be back to normal in 20 minutes.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "What do \"seed\" and \"keys\" mean?",
    "answer" : "Your keys encode the private information in your wallet, and are what allow you to spend coins and see incoming transactions.\nYour seed is just a version of your private key written in a way that’s easier for you to write down. Your seed and keys are actually the same thing, just in different forms!\nDO NOT ever give your seed or keys to anyone. Your funds will be stolen if you give out your seed or keys. Please write down your seed, however, and store it in a safe place (this will allow you to restore your wallet if you lose your phone.)\n"

  {
    "question" : "How many wallets can I create?",
    "answer" : "There is no limit! You can create as many wallets as you want.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "How can I restore my wallet?",
    "answer" : "Tap the profile icon on your dashboard (upper right), select Wallets, and then choose Restore Wallet. Then enter your seed (or your keys), and optionally enter a date before the first transaction in your wallet (this will speed up the syncing process.) You may need to keep the app open for 15-30 minutes in order to completely restore your wallet.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "What can I do if I lose my seed?",
    "answer" : "If you forgot your seed, you likely wrote it down somewhere. Please check your notes and look around on your computer. If you can’t find it anywhere, you may have backed up Oxen Wallet (in which case you would be able to restore from that backup.) If none of these work, there is unfortunately nothing that we can do.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "Do you collect any information about me or my wallet?",
    "answer" : "Oxen Wallet DOES NOT collect or record any information about you or your wallet. We care about your privacy.\nYour privacy can be compromised by connecting to a malicious node, so we recommend to use either the default nodes or your own.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "Where do you get the fiat data from?",
    "answer" : "The fiat data is pulled trough a gateway from CoinGecko.\nThe code of the gateway is open-source and does not collect or record any data, but by requesting data from the gateway you are exposing your IP and Fiat.\nThe Fiat conversation is disabled by default.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "Is it possible to reverse a transaction?",
    "answer" : "Unfortunately, as soon as a transaction has been submitted to the blockchain, there is no way to undo it. You can always cancel the transaction before it’s sent though, so always double-check the address before you send a transaction.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "What are subaddresses, and how do I use them?",
    "answer" : "A subaddress is basically a unique address that you can generate at any time. Coins sent to it will still arrive in your main wallet, but the person sending the coins can’t tell what your main address is.\nYou can make a new subaddress in the Receive screen by tapping the + next to the Subaddresses button. Enter a name for the subaddress and tap Add. Then just tap on the subaddress name when you want to use it!\nIf you’re paranoid, you should probably create a new subaddress every time you receive Oxen.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "I didn't receive my OXEN! What can I do?",
    "answer" : "If you didn't receive your Oxen, you might want to tap the Synchronize Icon on your dashboard (upper left) and hit Reconnect. If that doesn't work, go into the settings menu, tap the 'Current Node' box, and select a node with a green dot next to it.\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "How do I contact Oxen Wallet support?",
    "answer" : "Email team@oxen.io, join the Telegram at @LokiCommunity, or tweet @Oxen_io!\n"
  },
  {
    "question" : "Does owning Oxen make me an Investor?",
    "answer" : "No, it does not. It makes you a cool person, but with Oxen.\n"
