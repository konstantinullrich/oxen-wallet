The OXEN Wallet app (hereinafter, referred to as the "App") allows the use of accessing the Oxen Blockchain/network. You are not authorized, and nor should you rely on the App for legal advice, business advice, or advice of any kind. You act at your own risk in reliance on the contents of the App. Should you make a decision to act or not act you should contact a licensed attorney in the relevant jurisdiction in which you want or need help. In no way are the owners of, or contributors to, the App responsible for the actions, decisions, or other behavior taken or not taken by you in reliance upon the App.

If you notice any inconsistency, please report them on GitHub.
3.      Risks related to the use of the OXEN Wallet.
The App, the App’s owner the Oxen Project and Oxen Project owners, partners, employees, contributors, and any affiliates will not be responsible for any losses, damages or claims arising from events falling within the scope of the following five categories:
